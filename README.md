sshportal is a great SSH *Bastion*.

Your can find sourcecode and explaination here: https://github.com/moul/sshportal

But it lakes some features and simplicity some times.
For that I tried to build an API over this basition, but using it's database via the SQLAlchemy ORM.
Once the API is build, a new web interface will be build using VueJS.

To see how to install the API see: [installation](INSTALL.md)
